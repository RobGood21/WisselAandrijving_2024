A new method to drive switches, turnouts and oher accessories in model railroad layouts. I used the popular 28byj48 stepper to make a movement to switch the turnouts or other accessories like (rail)bridges.
4 steppers can be controlled by the module. Included is the NMRA DCC decoder so you can control the turnouts with DCC commands.
Everything is oen source so be free to use the designs, for hardware I have made a special shield for the arduino UNO please contact me by email for details.
